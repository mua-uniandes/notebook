Programming contest notebook for uniandes teams

The structure of the notebook is as modular as possible for every team can pick and choose the sections,
algorithms, and formulas relevant to them.
Following this idea the notebook is organized as follows
  - The main.tex files contains all the big sections for the notebook (e.g., geometry, graphs, optimization)
any big topic that might be relevant can be added here.
    - For each of the topics, there should be a new .tex file containing all the specific sections (e.g., algorithms, formulas, info, ) for that section.
    - Each of these sections should have an associated folder containing each of their specific sections as individual .tex files
